wpAjax
======

A Wordpress plugin for adding in AJAX page load support with callback events, HTML5 History API, localStorage caching, body class replacement and more.

## Tests

I am slowly writing tests. Some components of the plugin make it hard to test everything. I am using Q-unit for testing the Javascript and the plugin seems to be working thus far.

If you would like to contribute tests, I won't be mad.
